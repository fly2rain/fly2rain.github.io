<div class="summary">
    <p>I am currently a second year computer science Ph.D. student from UT Arlington. My supervisor is <a href="http://ranger.uta.edu/~huang/"> Prof. Junzhou Huang </a>. I am passionate at applying machine learning algorithms and creating new models to solve challenges met with the development of bioinformatics and biomedicine. Before coming to UT Arlington, I spent 3 years in <a href="http://english.ia.cas.cn/">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</a>. In CASIA, I built and tested intelligent algorithms for miniature autonomous vehicle. Besides that, I had also communicated science to over 10,000 people from 2013 to 2015.
