                    In big data era, many data are with weak labels. One challenge is how to learn fine-grained information from those weak labels.  In our problem of predicting patients' survival, only the giga-pixel level whole slide pathological images and patients-level survival labels are given. Some regions in the whole slide pathological images are discriminative for survival prediction and others are not. How to learn those fine-grained discriminative regions without expert-annotated ROIs is very challenging and critical in this problem. To solve this: <ul><li>One <b>deep attention-based model</b> was proposed to solve the challenging problem. Very promising results were achieved on two types of cancers datasets;</li><li>We are trying to generalize our model to solve other fine-grained learning problems with weak labels.</li></ul>

                        Survival analysis is very important in medical treatment, but leading research is challenged by three properties of medical data: 1) the datasets are usually in multiple views; 2) they are in small sample size; and 3) the whole slide pathology images are in gigapixel size. To solve those problems: <ul><li>Efficient deep learning models with specific training strategies were developed to solve the first two problems;</li><li>A novel framework was also created to solve the third challenge.</li></ul>

                            As a popular research topic, pedestrian detection has played an important role in both Intelligent Transportation Systems and Autonomous Vehicles. RGBD images are with the advantages of both RGB images and depth images. However, for the outdoor usage, the existing RGBD sensors like Kinect were inapplicable. Thus, in this research:

                                <li>
                                Collected over 10,000 RGBD outdoor pedestrain RGBD images;
